Here we need to check whether our dataset is linear or not

This is how the Weights and Biases are updated according to the model

Iteration No.0
[0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
Iteration No.1
[ 0. -1.  1.  1. -1.]
Iteration No.2
[ 1.  0.  2.  1. -1.]
Iteration No.3
[ 1. -1.  2.  2.  0.]
Iteration No.4
[ 0. -1.  2.  2. -1.]
Iteration No.5
[ 0. -1.  2.  2. -1.]

Predicted Output by our Model for training inputs[0,1,1,1] = 1
Expected Output was 1 as well

Predicted Output by our Model for training inputs[1,0,0,1] = 1
Expected Output was 0 as well

AS WE ARE GETTING THE EXPECTED OUTPUT AND THE PREDICTED OUTPUT IDENTICAL 
WE CAN SAY THAT OUR DATASET IS LINEAR
